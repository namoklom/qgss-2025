This repository serves as a technical archive of my work during the **Quantum Global Summer School (QGSS) 2025**, focusing on both the theoretical framework and the practical implementation of quantum computing concepts. The materials here are not only a record of exercises but also a structured workflow that transitions from fundamental principles to advanced quantum algorithms. The work emphasizes the use of **Python, qBraid, and Qiskit** as the primary tools for quantum circuit design, simulation, and visualization, while also incorporating supporting libraries for linear algebra, optimization, and data analysis. 

The repository is organized to highlight the **progressive nature of quantum computing education**: starting with environment setup and basic gate operations, advancing through canonical algorithms, exploring the limitations imposed by noise and decoherence, and culminating in hybrid variational methods designed for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. Each stage is approached with a combination of **mathematical rigor, circuit-level implementation, and empirical validation** through simulation. By systematically integrating quantum theory with computational experiments, this project reflects a workflow similar to what is practiced in modern quantum research and industry applications.
