# üåê QGSS 2025 ‚Äî Quantum Global Summer School

This repository documents my learning journey during **Quantum Global Summer School (QGSS) 2025**, focusing on **Quantum Computing fundamentals, algorithms, and applications**.

Each lab builds progressively ‚Äî from setting up the environment, understanding quantum states, implementing algorithms, addressing noise/error correction, to applying variational methods for real-world problems.
